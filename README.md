This is a recreation of a game me and some friends created as part of our final project for Computer
Science AP in high school. The original game was written in Pascal (TurboPascal) for DOS back in
1997 (Window 3.1 and Windows 95). It was a text based adventure so I have decided to keep that motif
although I may add some graphics at some point.

Below is the text or disclaimer included with the original game, keep in mind, me and my friends
were snarky high school seniors when we wrote this, the main difference being I'm no longer a high
school senior:

`This game is a demo version of things to come. It is a text based game about Roxboro and does 
nothing but insult the town. Before you play this game read the disclaimer. It was programed by 
3 guys who had nothing better to do for their Computer Science AP final project. It turned out to be
 the best project for that class. The programmers are listed in the title screen when you start the 
 program. You probably won't enjoy the game unless you are from Roxboro because there are a lot of 
 inside jokes. Some of the jokes are so inside that only the programmers themselves get it. So if 
 you are an evolved human being you will enjoy this program. If not bite me. We aren't here to 
 entertain anyone but ourselves and can you blame us we are just self righteous teenagers who are 
 sick of the small town we live in. If you want to pirate it we don't care give it to as many people 
 as you like. This version of the game is freeware so don't try to make any money off of it. And if 
 you do anyway find us and tell us how you did it so we can do the same.`    
   
`DISCLAIMER:`  
`This game may contain material that may offend some people. If you are from Roxboro we can almost guarantee you'll be offended. Real life characters that are used in this game are refered to by a first name basis only and gave us direct verbal permission to put them in the game and had full knowledge of it. If you are offended and want to take it up with the programmers then you can bite us or you can email us at this address:
Someguy@who.cares`  
`If you get a response you are a lucky guy. That is all.`
